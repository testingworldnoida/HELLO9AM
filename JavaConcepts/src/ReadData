Singleton Class:
Singleton class allow to create only 1 instance of class

Nested Class:
Writing a class within another is allowed in Java. The class written within is called the nested class.

Recursion
Recursion is a basic programming technique you can use in Java, in which a method calls itself to solve some problem.

Multithreading in java is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously.
A thread is a lightweight sub-process, the smallest unit of processing. 
However, we use multithreading than multiprocessing because threads use a shared memory area. 

Java provides Thread class to achieve thread programming. Thread class provides constructors and methods to create and perform operations on a thread.

start()	It is used to start the execution of the thread.
run()	It is used to do an action for a thread.
sleep()	It sleeps a thread for the specified amount of time.

Life cycle of a Thread (Thread States)

he life cycle of the thread in java is controlled by JVM. The java thread states are as follows:

New    -Start 
Runnable  (in runnable state, but thread scheduler didnt picked it yet)
Running   
Non-Runnable (Blocked)
Terminated

There are two ways to create a thread:

By extending Thread class
By implementing Runnable interface.
